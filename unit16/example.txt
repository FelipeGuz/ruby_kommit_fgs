I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting
language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it really, because it had
the smell of a toy language (it still has). The object-oriented language seemed very
promising. I knew Python then. But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it was a
true object-oriented language â€“ OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. As
a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented,
easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn't find one. So I decided to
make it.
